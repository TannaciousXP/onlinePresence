            I am a Javascript engineer with experience across the stack and a strong
            command of relevant technologies. Recently, I built a communication platform
            for hobbyists with the major features such as real-time messaging through
            Socket.IO, web-conferences with WebRTC, group events utilizing Google Maps
            API and OpenWeatherMap API to enhance the visualization of the event’s detail.
            The back-end was constructed with PostgreSQL for the aggregation of polymorphic
            data, and I utilized Knex together with Bookshelf to simplify SQL queries and
            facilitate seamless alterations to the database schema. As for the front-end, I
            modularized the components with React for a smooth and intuitive user interface
            and managed the state with Redux for e cient data  ow and improved maintainability.
