                  I am a Javascript engineer with experience across the stack and a strong command of relevant technologies. Recently, I built a communication platform for hobbyists with the major features such as real-time messaging through Socket.IO, web-conferences with WebRTC, group events utilizing Google Maps API and OpenWeatherMap API to enhance the visualization of the eventâ€™s detail. The back-end was constructed with PostgreSQL for the aggregation of polymorphic data, and I utilized Knex together with Bookshelf to simplify SQL queries and facilitate seamless alterations to the database schema. As for the front-end, I modularized the components with React for a smooth and intuitive user interface and managed the state with Redux for e cient data  ow and improved maintainability.
